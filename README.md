Beatbook is a personalized cultural agenda specialized in live music. 

It focuses on giving visibility to the three elements that make up live music: events, venues, and bands. 

It is social and collaborative, as it is the users themselves who generate the content. 

Its aim is to help the user find the most attractive plans for them according to their own musical preferences.
